<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">It’s customary at this time of year to look back over the past 12 months in reflection, and look forward to the coming year with anticipation. For many people, the new year is a time to make resolutions on things they wish to improve upon. We here at Visionary Realms are no different, as we continually set goals, adjust our timelines, make improvements and index our progress. One of our resolutions last year was to grow our team with a key addition or two if the right candidates came along and it was financially prudent. Little did we know of the upheaval the gaming industry would face in the final quarter of year and the glut of supremely talented people it would leave looking for a new opportunity. While our team is very financially disciplined - as you have to be when you’re an independent developer that has been largely crowdfunded - we also know when to take action on a rare event. With your unwavering support, we were able to offer positions to several key areas of development, and keep our long term budget in tact. Knowing that we could increase production speed and increase implementation of a myriad of systems and features without impacting our long term finances was an incredible boost to the team and showed us once again that we have the single greatest community in gaming. So from each of us here at Visionary Realms thank you for your continued support.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">We kick off January with an interview with one of the fine folks you helped bring on board - Ross Armstrong, our new Lead Animator who has oodles of industry experience. Next up is a feature which amongst the team is one of our favorites: Justin Gearhart’s continuing lore epic - The One Between the Winds. We continue with our latest iteration of Under Wraps as Game Producer Ben Dean looks back on the year that was and looks forward to what’s to come. Like every newsletter before it we end January with a look at our most important facet, our community. This month’s Community Spotlight member is Chris Kane who is looking forward to the unique experience and challenge that only a game like Pantheon can deliver.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">We are back from the holidays! The time off was nice to rest up and catch up with friends and loved ones but it also provided time to reflect on how far we’ve come in 2018. And looking back, the year was packed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">We kicked off 2018 by winning</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/pantheon-rise-of-the-fallen/news/the-most-wanted-mmo-of-2018-ispantheon-rise-of-the-fallen-1000047008" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Most Wanted MMO</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">from MMORPG.com for the second year in a row. We are humbled by your votes, have heard your wishes and thoughts and strive to deliver the best Pantheon it can be - the world needs this game.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Then in late January Pre-Alpha 2 kicked off. The world expanded to include Halnir Cave, one of Pantheon’s premier early-level dungeons. The new ability system was added which greatly expanded the diversity in spells and abilities. CohhCarnage joined us for</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/QWgKSQJtHrA" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">a stream of Halnir Cave</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">as did the legendary</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qnQD5xoQADE" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Jim Lee</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">of comic book art fame. This was the stream in which</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/qnQD5xoQADE?t=8010" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Brad demonstrated</span></a><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">the importance of not running ahead of your group.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Then in April came PAX East and what a show it was. Hundreds flocked to our booth to catch a glimpse of Pantheon. So many fans, in fact, that the show runners had to ask us to spread out our visitors as the crowd that gathered congested the entire aisle for much of the show. We met with future players and press alike, including MMORPG.com and MassivelyOP. You can read their thoughts</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://www.mmorpg.com/pantheon-rise-of-the-fallen/previews/pax-east-2018-hands-on-with-pantheon-1000012618/page/1" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">here</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">and</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://massivelyop.com/2018/04/10/pax-east-2018-hands-on-with-pantheon-rise-of-the-fallen/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">here</span></a><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">. We also hosted our first “official” meet and greet (although we did have a less formal one at 2017’s TwitchCon).</span></p>
<p></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Also at PAX East Pantheon stole the show at a panel called</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/3bMjXtmudS8" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Community Impact: How Players Shape Games</span></a><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">. Fun fact: also on this panel was the well-known and much beloved dwarf, Linda “The Brasse” Carlson who would later join the Pantheon team in November.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">While the booth at PAX was bustling and the play slots filled up fast; a few streamers who weren’t able to play at the show got a chance to head into Black Rose Keep live on air. First was</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/o3Holmesv34" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Lassiz</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">followed by</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/L_oFEy4YGTg" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">KoopaTroopa</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">and then</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/KwEiwRLQzTU" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">TheHiveLeader</span></a><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Heading into Pre-Alpha 3 in July details for</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/#section3" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">all 12 playable classes</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">were outlined for the first time. PA3 also offered testers 2 new zones: Avendyr’s Pass and Black Rose Keep. Players now had armor set models that physically affected their in-game character’s appearance. It was also around this time that we held our first</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/eq6ftMk21FA" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">MMO All-Star stream</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">with Fevir, TheHiveLeader, DocGotGame, Force Gaming and Vress.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://youtu.be/2FXXE4IWu6k" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">CohhCarnage returned to try out the Dire Lord</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">and PA3 was also the first time Pantheon was streamed without any devs at all. Community members NickHotS, Bazgrim, TehMartini, Saicred, Leksur and Yarnila</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://www.pantheonmmo.com/content/forums/topic/9231/what-a-community-stream" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">teamed up to conquer Black Rose Keep</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">on their own - and that they did!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Pre-Alpha 4 finished off the year with the introduction of a very early version of Faerthale. All classes were implemented in-game and playable up to level 40. Harvesting was added and other systems refined. The Pantheon Streamer program kicked off with some streams from selected streamers who were given access to the game and had a one-hour play session with the devs.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">What else happened in 2018?</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pantheonmmo/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Facebook</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">followers climbed to over 20k and</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pantheonmmo" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Reddit</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">subscribers to 14k. We brought on 5 new staff members and are bringing several more in the first quarter. Our November Pledge stand-alone drive helped make this happen along with all of our regular pledges - so once again, thank you!</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">And what’s to look forward to in 2019?</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/newsletter/2018_december_under_wraps/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">As discussed</span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">last month, Project Faerthale is underway. Now that we are back from holidays we are finalizing our scope for that release and setting some internal goal dates. Ross, our lead animator, is already working hard on new animations and the rest of the art team is developing the art for Project Faerthale and beyond. Programming is adding more to the existing tools like the ability editor,, planning out some new tools for a more robust and streamlined Perception System and adding more features, systems, stability and bug-squashing to the existing client. Design is fleshing out some systems and encounter designs and tech is looking into more robust back-end features.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Project Faerthale is the biggest release we’ve ever done, so it will take some time and we appreciate your patience and continued support as we approach this milestone! You can also look forward to a new website, lots of new videos, content and a few surprises along the way. So buckle in, grab your Codex and get ready for an incredible year!</span></p>

<p></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The end of 2018 wasn’t a happy time for everyone in the gaming industry as several high profile developers and studios were sold or downsized resulting in a lot of talented folks looking for work. Luckily, we have an amazing community behind us who rallied extra support to allow us to extend job offers in a timely manner. One of our more pressing needs was to bring in a Lead Animator and after interviewing several extremely qualified candidates we were happy to announce that Ross Armstrong was joining the team in that capacity. We sent David Schlow out to sit down with Ross and welcome him to the Pantheon team.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Welcome to the team, Ross! Can you explain a bit about what your role will be on Pantheon?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: Thanks, it's great to be here! I'm the Lead Animator on Pantheon and my role will change as we get further into production. Initially I'll be working closely with the Creative Director, Game Designers and Engineers to understand our quality objectives, gameplay intentions and define the appropriate animation style. Much of this initial work will be blocking out animations and working with Chris Perkins and Designers to understand the timing requirements that best suit the flow of our gameplay, abilities and so on. Since the "Animation Department" is new I'll be working with the Engineers and Tech Artists to refine the existing animation pipelines - laying the foundation for other animators to come on board and be up and running quickly. When the Animation team starts to grow, in addition to animation I'll also be handling critiques, scoping, scheduling, managing outsourcing, inter-departmental communications, and anything else animation-related. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Animation has been a hot button topic for a while now. What are the most common complaints you’ve heard so far, and how do you plan to address them?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: I'll get into more detail on this in a few of the questions below. Essentially we're early in production and in an effort to get up and running quickly we used animations from multiple sources and this can cause some of the popping, clunkiness and stiffness.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What do you think will be the most challenging part of animating Pantheon?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: I think defining a cohesive style that fits with the lore and the design of the characters will be the most challenging part. Pantheon has an aggressive production schedule and there's a ton of animation assets to create and that will also be a challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Are you using motion capture, and if not are there plans to?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: We're currently using a mix of both motion capture and hand-keyed animation. The intent there was to get the game up and running quickly so that Designers could get started creating the game systems and the Engineers could flesh out the underlying technology to support those systems. We're in the process of developing this solid foundation and our plan is to eventually replace all of the motion captured animation with hand-keyed animation. Ultimately, removing the motion capture/hand-keyed hybrid will create a more cohesive style that fits with our game lore and the characters we'll be creating.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What other ways are there of getting fluid and realistic motion? How do you go about making it feel organic and natural?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: While Pantheon will have realistic motion we haven't yet decided on the style or how realistic it will be. Likely there'll be a lot of iteration as a result of feedback from Chris and the Designers to make the animation feel "right". Additionally, there'll be a lot of collaboration between Engineering and Animation to further develop the animation state tree which will help create more fluid and natural transitions between animations. Lead Programmer Daniel Krenn has already done much of the heavy lifting for many of the animation systems we're planning for and I'm excited to start using them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Can you talk a bit about the synergy between ability development and animation? Are there abilities that don’t get made because the animations are too hard or don’t look right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: It's rare, if ever, that abilities don't get created because the animation is too challenging. Abilities are typically a joint effort between Engineering and Animation and VFX that's driven by Design. The decision to create an ability usually comes down to a cost analysis of how much time each department will have to spend creating it. Subsequently Design and Production assess if they want to proceed. If a particular ability is too expensive then the departments will collaborate and find ways to author it more efficiently while still maintaining Design's original vision.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Is there going to be racial specific animations?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: Yes, our intention is to have race specific animations. Dwarves and Ogres should move and fight differently to Humans, as an example.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Once you finish all the playing characters are there plans to animate the NPCs and wildlife?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A. Yes, we're currently focused mainly on the human race but we'll get to the point in production where we'll be animating NPCs and other races simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What other games have you worked on, and how does the animation in Pantheon differ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: I started off in the MMO genre as Lead Animator on Gods and Heroes: Rome Rising. It was a monumental project and the animation system was very granular. We authored paired defensive and offensive animations for all 6 weapon types - left, overhand, right, thrust and uppercut. We ended up with hours of animation by the end of the project. We’re not planning to be as granular on Pantheon. More recently I was Lead Animator on Marvel Heroes which was a lot of fun to work on. Marvel Heroes' animation was quite stylized though and I'm imagining that Pantheon will be more realistic but that's yet to be determined. It's going to be a collaborative effort to get the right look and feel of Pantheon and I'm looking forward to the challenge!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What’s the main difference between animating for film and games?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: There are lot's of differences between animating for film and games but the main difference is that you have a fixed camera in feature animation. A film is intended to be viewed whereas in games the user interacts with the characters in 3D and the approach to animation is very different. In games, your poses have to look good from every camera angle. When I worked on Smurfs 2 I was focused exclusively on animation - that was all I did. As a Lead Animator in games production, I also find myself with many more challenges than just the animation itself, there are also technical, production and management aspects to consider and the variety of challenges can be a nice change of pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What’s the most fun aspect of your job?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: I find it fun to have the opportunity to collaborate with most of the disciplines involved in games production - Design, Production, Engineering, VFX and Audio. I really enjoy working with Design and other creative folks to produce animation and iterate on it to realize the overall vision of the game. In addition to the animation itself, I like the other challenges like the technicalities of setting up an efficient pipeline, scoping and scheduling etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Of the systems we are innovating on, what’s your favorite?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: I haven't been with VR very long but the abilities system sounds like it's going to be innovative and fun to play.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What class will you play at launch?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: Probably the Rogue - the abilities sound right up my alley!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: What’s your Favorite Zone?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: Faerthale. It's really coming along nicely. I recently saw some concepts and they're awesome!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Q: Is there anything else you’d want the Pantheons to know about you?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A: This is a great team of folks that are working hard to create an awesome game. There's been a lot of hard work and passion put into it and that's really obvious to me. I'm really glad to be a part of Pantheon!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><br></span><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The One Between the Winds</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Part 2</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:start;"></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">It was early morning and a heavy fog sat in a quiet wood. Dense as a cloud, the fog meandered through thickets and over footpaths like the frayed ends of a white and billowy dress. And like a cloud the fog was not idle, but moved as one tall and gentle stream. To pass through it would wet your skin and the flora of the wood was pregnant with dew.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The wood was known as Redgrove, for though the trees were neither the oldest nor the youngest on Kingsreach, they alone had leaves colored with deep crimson and a white, peeling bark. Those leaves were red not from an autumn that comes and goes as a herald of winter, but an autumn that never ends. For this is the ever autumn of Faerthale, home of the Elves of the fabled Lucent Tree, once of the planet S’iolaen and now of Terminus. The creatures of Redgrove were known as Wanderbeasts, a term that describes the group fairly but did not suit any single creature altogether well. Here roamed the small drolings and the tall gaelu, winged foxes (called enfields) and on occasion a brazen Fae. Even a pair of Spriggan dwelt herein, though none would confuse their kind for a mere wanderbeast. None of these creatures were particularly evil and a few were quite good, yet all saw the fog as a comforting curtain of night.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The mist continued its sprawl up the incline of Redgrove, gathering in a hem at the shoreline of a lake called the Pool of Morning. The fog hugged the water in a perfect curve, as if it were the arched spine of a slumbering feminine form. This quirk of nature is called the Maiden of Morning, and clouds of mist hung above the water’s surface like tangles of the Maiden’s unkempt hair. Her breathing mirrored the far away sounds of the two waterfalls that fed into the Pool from the opposite side. Frozen gusts of air fell from the Roan mountains high above the falls, creating a foundry of mist that birthed the Maiden, the fog and the climate of Redgrove itself. In the moments before dawn the Maiden slept most peacefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">At the far end of Redgrove stood a temple built upon a broken piece of mountain, known as the Adytum of Aellos. (Also called “the Dawn Approaching”, Aellos is a giver of prophecy, said to be the first who sees Tollaem in his darkness unknown.) Upon the Adytum the rays of Siros, sun of Terminus, would first fall. At dawnlight the temple’s marble columns burn as heralds for the coming morn. For the Roan mountains make the rising sun difficult to observe, and the light upon the Adytum signaled for all that day was at hand. Swift rays of sunlight ate at the garment of fog gathered at the base of the temple summit. Soon Redgrove’s brilliant colors were being revealed beneath the fading mist. The heat of Siros made the vapors of forest fog leap like dancers put to flight. Each seem to hide in the the face of a fallen red leaf, with only a kiss of dew left on their crimson lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">On a cliff pass high in the Roan mountains, a silhouette watched the valley turn from night to day. The wind kicked at the edges of his cloak, mocking his stillness with taunts of what lay ahead. The wind barked at him with anger, spitting snow from a throat of ice and stone. He turned his face toward it without expression. This bluff marked the start of the Floor of Heavens, an Elvish name meant to describe heights so great they reached, “the foyer of the celestial realm”. Peeking plateaus such as this one were like balconies in the stars, some even used as holy sites for the Elves nearly a thousand years ago. Still this trail could lead all the way to the frozen heart of the Roans if one so desired to take it. The figure would not do so. His quarry was nearer at hand, and under a different sort of frost.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">His name was Saevyn. He was not fond of the cold but his teeth did not chatter. He had been to the Floor before, though not for many years, and could still recall the cracks in each boulder like the scars on a looming giant’s body. He remembered how the wind caused specks of ice to cut at his eyes, how preferable the ice was to the blade-like stones it threw farther up the mountain. Saevyn was an Ashen Elf and often served as envoy on matters of state for the Anadem Council. His habits of study and skills of memory garnered him a reputation in courts beyond Faerthale, and his ability to discern the truth in a moment put even his friends on edge. Saevyn was also something of a wizard, though he considered that reputation of secondary importance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Beneath a hood, Saevyn’ hair was several shades of grey, twisting in three separate braids that fell below his waist. His face did not look old despite the grey, though his eyes reflected a life of many years. His skin was pale but not sickly, and below the center of each eye was a vertical line of symbols, cresting unevenly over each cheek. Across his back was a rod wrapped in unimpressive cloth, the head wider than the body. His cloak was dark slate, woven from countless threads but without bulk. It had no ornamentation save for silver clasps that fastened up the left side of his chest. Upon the back of each hand were similar markings to those under his eyes, though these were interwoven with what looked like writings or scripture. On his feet were leather boots, oddly brown, the only piece of clothing that suggested he took the dreadful cold seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The boots were sunk in a blanket of frozen fog that rolled slowly over the cliff’s edge. Saevyn spoke a word, or rather sang it, and there appeared between his thumb and pointer something of a quill pen. Yet the quill was not a bird’s feather, but instead an insect’s prismatic wing. With this tool he drew invisible lines in the air and there appeared glowing lavender lines in the sheet of frozen fog at his feet, matching stroke for stroke.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">As Saevyn drew he repeated the single-word song several times over, though it seemed to be out of enjoyment and not to manifest more of the insect quills. Though his pace of verse was slow with whimsy, his pen was decisive and swift.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">“Rrro-pah-loe, rrro-pah-loe…”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">In a flurry he finished the wings: wide and sharp-edged, with crystalline veins. Saevyn waved his hand, the pen erasing itself in a moment. He knelt and slid bare fingers beneath the snow, cupping the drawing as if it were alive and lifting it from the sheet of fog. From a hidden pocket he produced a handful of shimmering stones, each small as a pebble. He chose one that was red and intricate, looking more like living tissue than a hard gem. Saevyn slid the stone into the thin body of snow with great care, tenderly smoothing over the wound. The light from his art was fading, helpless as a flower in the snow. He brought his face very near to the drawing.</span></p>
<p></p>
<img src="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/images/19-january-newsletter/tales-from-the-fire/3-sm.jpg" alt="" style="float:none;height: ;width: "/>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">“Now,” he whispered, “you come with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The red from the stone mixed with the lavender light, pulsing in a soft rhythm. At once the wings of the drawing stirred like they were waking from a long sleep. With beats slow and then furious, it struggled to break free. Suddenly it was not a drawing at all but a creature fully formed, the lavender lines cradling its snow-born body. Saevyn stood tall just as the delicate wings of the creature started to flutter and lift out of the snow, the left sticking a moment more than the right. When it left his palm, Saevyn blew the remaining snow in his hand at the weak beauty like a gust from the mighty mountains. The creature struggle to regain control, rising and falling with the greater wind. For a moment it appeared to lose, soaring dangerously close to the cliff’s abyss. Yet Saevyn’ did not move a hair as it fell, though his eye did not falter from its flight.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The creature gained control and soon flew stable, circling Saevyn once in a slow, victorious glide. It perched on his right shoulder. Saevyn did not smile, though the creature’s settling feet seemed to satisfy his aims. The wind was whispering to him now, calming itself with invitation and promise. There were no barks, no biting grains of ice -- the mountain was hiding its face behind its glacial beauty. Saevyn knew better and set the creature in a small box of leather that was nestled in the skirt of his cloak. He kept the lid open for the little pet and pressed on into the rising winds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Yet as Saevyn ascended his preoccupation with the mountain itself seemed to diminish with each step. The wind could howl, he thought, but it was only ever the wind. The purpose of his journey began to assert itself over physical concerns, and it weighed on his mind like snow gathering on a roof.</span></p>
<p></p>
<img src="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/images/19-january-newsletter/tales-from-the-fire/4-sm.jpg" alt="" style="float:none;height: ;width: "/>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn was headed to the White Gate, a neglected outpost town that was once the Elves first home on Terminus. It was the first expression of Elven craftsmanship this world had ever seen, it ought to have been as sacred as a relic, Saevyn thought. But that was nearly a thousand years past. The fortress-like walls had endured centuries of abuse by the Roans and abandonment by its builders. Many structures in this world were called ancient yet were truly not so old. Others were of great age and yet retained their glory. The White Gate was somewhere between ancient and merely old, yet looked as though it was born of an age long before the Elves. Saevyn had considered why this inaugural feature of Elven history had been permitted to wither so. It seemed an anomaly to their culture, an unwell kin who received no treatment. It was not uncommon to see a Human dwelling or town crumble even if it was being lived in (or slept in). Their work was inferior to that of Elves, as was often their ethic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">In the last decade the dormancy of the White Gate began to bear a cost. Over the dead body of the town came Gorian mad men, pale raiders who often fought in the frost capped mountains without so much as an animal skin on their shoulders. In their wake were Colossi, towering beasts of stone and magic, rivals of the mighty Elvonnen giants. Therefore the White Gate was brought back up to a defensible standard and control over the outpost was given to a band of Ember Elves known as Dythiir’s Hand. Since that time infiltration at the White Gate had ceased and may even have been reversed, though there was concern from the Council about the zeal of such counterattacks. Greater foes lay beyond the walls in the belly of the Rons, it would be a shame to provoke them.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Yet those foes were not Saevyn’s concern. Though he did often serve in the capacity of envoy for the Anadem Council, diplomacy with bloodthirsty axemen was not where his strengths lay. He excelled in the dispassionate quarrels of government, though he had no special love for it. He saw his gifts as tools for the Council, Elvenkind, and above all else the preservation of the Lucent Tree. But on this journey he bore no official tidings or permissions, in fact he hoped to forestall action by the Council. This mission lay at the intersection of his skills and his heart, a place more chilling than any towering mountain or band of half-nude warriors.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn had not gone far when he froze as soon as his foot his the ground. In an instant a great burst of power rippled through his whole body. His vision went dark and his frame shook as if a hand had gripped the bones through his flesh and struck his sternum with the force of an battle hammer. His breath left him with the blow, yet there was no enemy near to him. There was nothing at all.</span></p>
<p></p>
<img src="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/images/19-january-newsletter/tales-from-the-fire/5-sm.jpg" alt="" style="float:none;height: ;width: "/>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">“Why here?” he whispered between gasps. “Why now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn took several steps back to steady himself, nearly falling to one knee. His breathing was sharp but beginning to steady, though his vision took time to return.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn reached around his right side to feel for the tightly wrapped staff. It was still there, secure as ever, aligned with his spine. He squinted at the rocks around him for a sign of movement and listened for a disturbance of flight, but the air was still. Last of all he reached a hand inside his cloak and felt about his neck. He steadied himself against a marbled boulder and finally caught his breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn then glanced back down the frozen trail, the relative warmth of the valley finding a voice of its own, beckoning him. He thought of how the mountain breeze would be a fine companion on a return trek, and how long it would otherwise be before he would glimpse the Lucent Tree again. His dwelling was stocked with fresh herbs and spices, scrolls and grain wine. They might spoil before he returned. Before long Siros would retire, drawing the curtain of night back over Faerthale. The Maiden of Morning would wait by the Pool ‘til she was strong enough to walk among the high grass and crimson leaves of Redgrove. At last she would slumber next to the water’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Saevyn looked at the small leather box with his creature in it. It was still, so still it must be resting, he thought. He fastened the lid ever so gently and looked north, turning his back to the valley once more. There would be no way through this except into the mountains, or off a cliff.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">1) What is your main character's in-game name and how did you come up with it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Typically my in-game name is McFly. But lately, I’m trying to embrace my inner RP’er so I might switch it up for the launch of the game and create something a little more immersive. The history of McFly just comes from my love of the Back to the Future movies.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">2) What interests you the most about Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Most, if not all of my favourite moments in gaming had 2 things in common:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">a) The possibility of loss loomed over my head with every action I took. Whether entering a new zone or trying to kill a red-conned mob. If I suffered as a result of my own incompetence, I either improved myself or seek out someone who could help me.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">b) The games had worlds that were worth exploring. These days fast travel, instant teleports to dungeons and other “accessibility features” undercut an opportunity for true exploration thus removing any motivation to care about the world you’re in. Pantheon seems to come from developers that understand players want to be challenged and if deserving, rewarded. They know that the struggle to explore (the world and its community) should inspire and exhilarate players.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">3) What will your main race and class be and why?</span></p>
<p></p>
<img src="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/images/19-january-newsletter/community-spotlight/elf-rogue-sm.jpg" alt="" style="float:none;height: ;width: 756px"/>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">There are so many interesting races, hopefully, I can choose! But will likely be either Dark Myr or Elf. Though I’ve never played one before, I’m considering a Rogue. (But I’ll play a Bard if it’s in for launch)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">4) What is your favorite system, mechanic or feature so far in Pantheon?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I have been really impressed with the plans for the Soundscape in Pantheon. Especially how it might function with the perception system. A few years back when reading what Chris ‘Joppa’ Perkins wrote about the plans to leverage music and sound design to create deep, immersive gameplay experiences; I was hooked. As an audio guy myself, I love being immersed within the sounds of a world. With the music and sounds that have already been released I can’t wait to explore Terminus with the Music option turned ON!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">5) If you could enter the game and visit anywhere in Terminus for 1 hour, where would you go and why?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Faerthale. It’s a place I could envision myself just spending time exploring, relaxing or just socializing. When preparing to read the lore of the Elven race for one of my videos, I just fell in love with the traditional yet fresh take on the Elven race.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">6) Finally, if you had to choose between having a real-world talent of mind-reading or forever having secret GM abilities on all of your Pantheon characters, what would you choose and why?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">While I have always envied the GM abilities in my gaming past; real-world mind reading sounds too good to pass up. As a voice actor, it would give me a huge advantage when trying to interpret a director or producers notes and directions.</span><span style="font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"> </span></p>
