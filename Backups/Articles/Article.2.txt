<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">As we reflect on the end of the year and engage in the holiday spirit, we here at Visionary Realms count ourselves as very fortunate. While it would be easy to be green with envy over the big studios with seemingly unlimited budgets, we know that we have been given a rare and amazing gift - the ability to craft our game as we see fit, to adhere to our vision, to resist compromise and to press ahead in creating the challenging, community based world that is lacking in today's market. We’ve been given this gift by you, our amazing supporters, and we are truly honored and appreciative of it, and we know how precious it truly is.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">With your help in our latest pledge drive we were able to further expand our team, you can read more about that in our first feature this month as Game Producer Ben Dean is back with lots of important information and updates in</span> <a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/newsletter/2018_december_under_wraps/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Under Wraps.</span></a> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Our game testers have been exploring the Elven land of Faerthale in our latest Pre-Alpha session, and sticking with that theme</span> <a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/newsletter/2018_december_rogues_gallery/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Rogue’s Gallery</span></a> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">returns this month with a look at the Spriggan, an ancient race of sentient treefolk whose roots can be traced all the way back to the creation of Terminus itself. It can never be stated enough how much community means to Pantheon, and to that end our next two features this month revolve around our supporters. First, Roenick sits down with several members of our awesome Pre-Alpha test crew this month for a Q&amp;A about their</span> <a href="http://www.pantheonmmo.com/newsletter/2018_december_player_experiences/" target="_blank"><span style="color: rgb(51,122,183);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">experiences</span></a> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">with the game so far and then we wrap it all up with our latest Community Spotlight, an Enchanter known as Janus.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Another hearty thank you to all of you for your continued support for Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen. Our November Pledge Drive wrapped up last week and we were able to raise enough to secure some top talent as well as get some commissioned art lined up. Both of these components are going to play an important part in the next phase of Pantheon development.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"></p>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">THE TEAM GROWS</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">First, let’s talk about the team expansion!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">We’ve brought on a brand new lead animator who will be joining us next week. He’s got oodles of experience in animating, leading animation teams and MMO-specific animations so he’s the right person for the job. We’re very excited to get him on the team. Be sure to keep an eye out for a formal introduction soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Additionally, we are bringing on another concept artist who will help the rest of the art team to get new work into the development pipeline.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Finally, we’ve got a new character artist.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">We are also posting a few new jobs soon. These are for a VFX artist, a web developer and a position in Development Operations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"></p>
<h4><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">PROJECT FAERTHALE</span></h4>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">So, what are all these positions pointing to? Why an exciting new Pantheon build of course!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">For the first time since development started we are bringing together the full Pantheon experience, with all of the systems, animations, models, sounds, and effects one would expect to see in a modern game. With the end of Pre-Alpha 4 coming up in a couple of short weeks, we are happy with the state of Pantheon and it’s time to really flesh out the concepts and systems we have in place. We also aim to add in a few new systems we have talked about but haven’t quite worked into a Pre-Alpha build.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">This project, dubbed Project Faerthale, will show Pantheon as it is meant to be experienced. Notice I said “experienced” and not “played” because we believe this next iteration will be much, much closer to our goal of creating a full world, a home, not just a game. It will be the culmination of awesome systems complimented by thoughtful visual effects, animations and sounds. It will be representative of the minimum caliber of game we are targeting for launch. It will also include some exciting new NPCs and at least one significant boss encounter, which is where our new character artist comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">This will require intense, sustained focus from all departments, from programming, to tools, to art and animation, to lore, to design, to tech and db... and everything in between. Most importantly, this is going to take time.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">This massive milestone means that after Pre-Alpha 4 wraps up, we won’t have another client out for our testers for some time. We will keep all of our community up-to-date on the state of Pantheon and Faerthale, but expect a delay before the world opens to play again. We are quite confident you’ll agree it will have been worth the wait.</span></p>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">THE SEED AND THE WYRM</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">There are countless myths about the origin of Terminus. Orcs claim the planet was once a ring of titanic mountains strung together by bridges water, ice and magma. Ancient deities fought from each mountain, pushing them together into one mass that has been made smooth by the waters of time. Hieroglyphs of the Giganaa suggest there was one progenitor for all magic, language and life, who knit the planet together from the fabrics of other worlds. The Tholen recount a lineage of dragon masters that stretches all the way back to the dawn of the planet. They name four flying beasts that each heralded a new season on their wings, yielding autumn, winter, spring and summer in the wake of their flight across the planet.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">When compared to the scale of these tales the story of the Seed and the Wyrm may be a book left on the shelf. Its narrative is not so loud or terrific, not at least upon glance of the cover and is recounted only by the treefolk known as Spriggan. While there is evidence in support of the other legends the Seed and the Wyrm lingers on with a peculiar credibility and enduring interest. It is a story with ancient roots that bears fruit to this very day, shortening the travel back into time like a new bloom on the tip of an old tree’s branch.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Now, to the telling.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">In the days before time, hands reached through darkness and birthed a new light. This light was called the Seed of Life, and the hands buried the Seed in a sphere of soil that hung among the heavens. A womb of ore, mineral and dust, it was by any other name a planet, one the Spriggan would call Noa, but is more commonly referred to as Terminus. (No other race is known to use the namesake Noa, and it does not appear to have been altered through the ages as with Aevozul or Nhystyrrok.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Out from the Seed of Life grew limbs of gigantic roots, which coursed through the layers of the planet and burst forth on the surface, spreading creation throughout the world. From the roots of the Seed came all of nature: seas teeming with life and rivers in kind; mountains and glaciers given their place and form; orders of beasts and plants birthed and set free to roam; and finally the first treefolk, a lineage of immense creatures meant to guide the flood of creation that whelmed over the planet. These were trusted with the power to sculpt life within the palm of their very own hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">These creatures were known as the Entaa’niri, though adventurers of today know them commonly as Ent. There are well known legends of their heart-stopping height, with some reaching as tall as a small mountain and towering above every tree on the globe. Few of these titans still remain on Terminus, with the youngest generations counted among the oldest living creatures on the planet. They are largely passive in nature, save for the outlier, and live as stewards of the most ancient and deep forests, those nurtured on the arcane as much as Siros the sun. Legend claims that the roots of Ent may be able to reach through the crust of the earth and grasp a tendril of the mothering root that created them, though the connection may never grow so strong as to invite the attention of the enemy of the Seed.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Beneath the layers there churned a foe of the Seed of Life, known as the Great Wyrm of the Abyss. This monster may perhaps be a draconic kin to the Dragons of Sea and Air, and its devious offspring are sometimes referred to as the Dragons of Earth, or basilisks. These creatures are often limbless, flightless and in great fury which may stem from their lot as the bastard branch of Dragonkind. While their origins are not clear apart from their patriarch Wyrm, their lineage carries a consistent theme of rage against the Rhy’Vulrene and Sol’Kromane, if not always a capability to match their power. For basilisks the crust of the earth is their sky, the hollows of caves their sea, therefore excursions onto the face of the planet are rare. Below the surface is their dwelling place, a realm that holds few challengers and even fewer threats. However, the longer basilisks remain in the depths of darkness the more blind they become, losing the ability to discern light with their own eyes. (It should be noted that his exchange does not limit the threat they pose if one is encountered at the bottom of some abyssal well.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Hungry for the power the Seed of Life bestowed upon the world, the Great Wyrm hunted out the roots that crossed the pockets of darkness that existed between the layers of the rock, soil and ore. Greedily he ate at the defenseless limbs of the Seed, growing in size and strength as a result. Yet of such magnitude were the roots that even the mammoth Wyrm required years to sever and consume them. He gave no pause for centuries and as life spread across the surface of Noa hundreds of root limbs were being severed beneath it. In time only dozens remained connected to the surface, then fewer than ten. Then only one.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">At the forest of this final great root the Seed of Life birthed a new kind of creature. These were smaller and more numerous than the Entaa’niri, but far more nimble and full of youth. If the Entaa’niri were the ancient eyes overseeing creation, these younger kin would be the hands and feet that dwelt among it. Their contribution would be in training the tender stalk to break through dry ground, not unlike the matriarch Seed herself had done ages before.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">These new offspring of the Seed of Life were known as her Spriggan, and it is said they bore the markings of the Seed of Life, who they call “The Face in the Deep”. To them she gave the Verdant Shards, sacred crystals that hold a portion of the Seed’s power. Yet no more had the Face in the Deep instructed the Spriggan on what the Verdant Shards were than the Great Wyrm devoured the final root, and her presence vanished from their sight.</span></p>
<p></p>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">THE FIRST WANDERERS</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">At this time the Spriggan were severed from the Face in the Deep and their existence was put under constant threat by the children of the Wyrm. Thus they sought out their brethren the Entaa’niri, who counseled and instructed them on the path that lie ahead. For the Face in the Deep had not born them in futility. Though the Seed had withdrawn, her children were not abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The Entaa’niri told the Spriggan they must not believe all was lost, or even that this was a day of defeat. Instead, they were to reach out across all of Noa in triumph, ensuring that life would spread throughout the planet, enduring on its own now that the Seed of Life was no longer giving direct aid. They warned the Spriggan against despair, knowing that the Face in the Deep had made them of tender heart in a way the Entaa’niri did not possess. They would carry the Face of the Deep to every corner and cavern, as soldiers and signal bearers. For the Great Wyrm was not the only evil in their world, as the foe of Life will ever be Death, no matter the form each takes.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Yet the Spriggan still bore great concern, doubting they could journey to each of the broken fountains of creation the Seed had made. How would they find these hollows that lie scattered across Noa’s face? To this the Entaa’niri spoke of the first purpose of the Verdant Shards.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Though the Seed was no longer working through the great roots, many lesser roots remained throughout the body of Noa. Of great aid to the Spriggan would be those that pathed just below the surface of the planet, known collectively as the World Root. (The roots of this weaving growth were thin in body, without great power when compared to the roots which ran out from the Seed of Life itself. Thus it avoided interest from the Great Wyrm or his basilisks.) The Verdant Shards would open the pathways of the World Root, transporting the Spriggan great distances in a moment’s time. These points of passage became known as the Wandering Stones, a namesake which endures to this day, as does their usage, which has fallen largely to Druids and those of their ilk.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Near to some of the Wandering Stones the Spriggan began their custodianship of the land, developing domains known as Groves. In time they would resist foes too extraordinary to list here and would restore what was lost while guiding mortalkind on how to lean on nature without destroying it. Their role would diminish over time, as creation found its footing apart from even their aid. But they must always be ready to war on behalf of the Face in the Deep, a charge they would take up with deadly fervor over countless centuries of existence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Thus the Spriggan spread across the globe. Not as orphans, but wanderers.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">OF KINGS AND QUEENS</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Spriggan obey a familial hierarchy. Each Grove is overseen by a king, called an Oa, who pledges to carry out the mandate of the Face in the Deep. Every Grove must have a queen as well, known as an Ua, who oversees the cultivation of new Spriggan. Without her role the Grove will perish as the delicate threading of the Spriggan spirit only her magic can perform. An Ua’s voice is said to be that of nature itself, at once a bird and a wind, a brook and a storm. Her beauty as well is seen in the raiment of her hair-gown, a living tapestry of ivy, flowers and birds of every sort. Her headdress may hold active nests or a living bouquet of flowers the likes of which few on Terminus have ever glimpsed. Spriggan Oa may live for a thousand years and reign for half of that time or more, and their role is rarely subservient to or dominant of the Ua, unless the difference in age is of extreme significance. Most often their positions exist as one unit, working in tandem to preserve the Grove above all else. Spriggan hierarchy are responsible for stewarding and cultivating generations of Spriggan, a process that begins by harvesting a splinter of the Verdant Shard which is wrapped in a soft flame known as the Verdant Fire. This crystal will become the Spriggan heart, growing with the creature itself and blooming into the living flame that shines from within their eyes until the time of their passing. The Spriggan body is formed from a piece of the king and queen themselves, woven around the crystal fragment and planted in the folds of the Ua’s living garment for a time. There are rare occasions in which a Spriggan turns from the path of stewardship and chooses to forsake the Grove in favor of subversive strength, some choosing to challenge the Oa himself. Here it is the Oa’s choice as to whether the violating Spriggan is banished from the Grove or may attempt to rejoin their people over time.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">THE GLORIOUS PROCESSION</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Spriggan are notoriously slow to die of natural cause. They are more resilient than common trees to blight or beetle (though not invulnerable) and age at a pace closer to glaciers than Humans (a mild exaggeration). Thus in the evening of life Spriggan will find a final home to “root” into the earth, growing their feet deep into the ground and turning their arms to sprawling branches. Over years their body will twist and change into something more tree than Spriggan, though their face and the light of the Verdant Fire will last ‘til final death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">A chief desire is a rooting location that has been used by ancestors of their Grove family line. The ground itself must be of good soil, untainted by poison, drought or climates which they are not accustomed to. (While much more hardy than common flora, Spriggan are created with ranges of adaptation but may not live or die in an environment wholly unsuited to their makeup). Spriggan prize this “well suited ground” so dearly they may wander the face of Terminus for decades in pursuit of it, mournfully breaking down in body and eventually spirit if they cannot attain it. Often these pitious creatures will fall prey to cowardly warriors, treasure hunters or simply the wind itself, breaking them apart under the hammer of storms and seasons. These Spriggan find no good rest in the world, fading into the earth like a common log rotting into the ground upon which it fell. Some may even enter the ocean itself and walk until the tide carries them away, or simply stand in the surf until their Verdant Fire is extinguished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Yet for those who do root well the end of life is a season of tranquility and honor. Spriggan bear great respect for rooted progenitors, protecting their state and preserving their heritage. (This is perhaps why some who wander may never root even if good ground is found, as the lack of earnest protection by succeeding generations means their rooted state is nothing more than a target to the outside world.) To age into that of a fixed tree, becoming a fruitful feature of nature itself and providing a home for wildlife, is seen as an end worthy of the Face in the Deep’s gift of life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">As rooters advance in years they will become fruitful in one of two ways, which can be affected by their environment and overall health. The most common is the Seed of the Fruit, a cyclical state in which edible organics grow from the branches of the Spriggan, once it turns into a stable version of what most mortals regard as a “tree”. With arms now formed into full branches, Spriggan may bear a significant harvest throughout the entire year, as even in dying the Verdant Fire sustains life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The second and less common path is the Seed of the Spawn. The seeds the rooted Spriggan can produce are living creatures that roam purely on their own, though they do not have the Verdant Fire and are not true Spriggan. Their first stage is that of an ordinary-looking seed, yet unlike an acorn or oak nut the Spawn are able to burrow themselves into the soil itself. Once burrowed they will develop under their parent Spriggan and become Seedlings, which are curious and wild creatures with a childlike personality. Smaller than a Gnome, Seedlings may in time grow to that of a Droling, rising to more or less than half the height of a Human male and growing in physical complexity -- as well as destructive or bountiful capabilities. (The phrase, “Catch a Seedling, raise a Droling” was born of this dynamic, and describes an opportunity that may hold unforeseen difficulty or unplanned benefit.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">In either case the role of a rooted Spriggan is that of a closing chapter in the Seed and the Wyrm, and a final victory for the Seed of Life. The war between the Seed and the Great Wyrm has outlasted countless ages and even some names of Terminus. While it appears to have ebbed for longer than Dwarves have dwelt hereupon, who is to say it cannot resume anew. Both sides may once more grapple for their fate on this ancient planet, no matter which of its mythic origins bears the most fruit.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="color: rgb(249,186,31);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Pre-alpha Player Experiences</span> <br></h3>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><em>Posted date / 12.12.18</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">If it isn’t obvious by now, we here at Visionary Realms are working our tails off to bring our MMORPG into the future. Part of what makes Pantheon so special is our own desire to make (and play!) a game we think is challenging, rewarding and above all else - fun. So it’s easy for us to talk about the game (which in Brad’s case may be endlessly.) But even if we accomplish what we set out to do, it will ultimately come down to whether you, the fans, love it as well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">With that in mind our fearless adventurer, Roenick, ventured forth into the great abyss, and sat down with a couple of headstrong testers to find out exactly how we’re doing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The names of our testers have been shortened to protect the guilty… uh… we mean their identity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">1. How would you describe your experience thus far in Pre-Alpha?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I would describe my experience as gripping, inspirational, entertaining and breathtaking! This is the first time that an MMO has captured my attention fully at such an early stage of development. Being able to participate in the PA has given me the opportunity to meet so many amazing gamers who are now friends and people that I hang out and talk with online, daily. The experience has left me with hope that soon, there will be a fantastical place to hide away from the real world and immerse ourselves in adventures and stories to tell for generations to come.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I would describe my experience so far during Pre-Alpha as exactly that, Pre-Alpha where testing is performed and bugs are continuously being squashed to make the game better. Not as an early access to a near polished game. Visionary Realms is going down what I believe to be the a good road to go down.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The Pantheon Pre-Alpha has been so much fun! I can’t explain how great it feels to dungeon crawl in an open world setting with a group of buddies. It’s very refreshing! It’s been too long since there has been a new game of this style. It’s also been great running into other players in Terminus, and not knowing exactly what to expect. Most people are totally friendly, so it’s usually some friendly chatter or helping one another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Priceless. The community/dev interaction has been stellar and continues to trend in a positive direction. Watching the world grow and evolve has been an incredible journey and having the opportunity to understand the who/what/when/where/why and how has been quite fulfilling, to say the least.I wanted to try and break the game and fill out a ton of bug reports but at the same time I really wanted to make the most out of my session and enjoy some meaningful time with friends.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Overall, the experience has been great. There are plenty of bugs to find and abilities/areas to test. The devs have tried to fix all the problems as soon as they could, if they could.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I've had a blast so far in PA. Always anxious for that next testing session. And always wanting more when the session comes to a close. It’s been amazing being on the ground floor of the creation of a brand new world. Helping to build the foundation, of what will become my MMO home for years to come, has been a privilege.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">It's been great so far, the journey has been amazing, seeing the constant steps made moving the game forward have been a blast. Time really flies when you are having so much fun, meeting new people and engaging with the Staff.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">2. What has been your most memorable moment thus far?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Even though I made some fun memories with my group as we pushed the envelope by leveling quickly and defeating challenging group content, the most memorable moment for me wasn’t anything that noteworthy. One time when adventuring in Avendyr’s Pass, my group got a very large and unexpected pull. With some quick thinking, teamwork, and communication, we were able to overcome all odds and survive, despite suffering a couple quick deaths. The rush I felt when challenged like that is something that is rarely felt in most modern MMOs. That’s the great thing about Pantheon; memorable moments are made with almost every play session. Even ordinary accomplishments and gameplay feel extremely satisfying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The first time I logged in. I remember I just sat there and stared at the screen, taking in the view, listening to the sounds and watching all the happy players around me. I actually had some joyful tears form. I had to take a deep breath, ground myself…. and then I dove in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I would have to say that for me so far the most memorable moment would be on my first real venture into Halnir's Cave. We found the Perception trigger and picked up the key preparing for a battle. I noticed a crack in the floor with some mean looking Wraiths below us, they vanished! Next thing I knew Wraiths came around the corner to say hello to me and my group. Wipe after wipe I couldn't help but laugh. One of the devs was attempting to help us recover our corpses because there seemed to be an apparent issue with catching aggro through the floor. I bet we spent a good 30-45 minutes trying to get our gear back. But in my opinion, it's that kind of silliness that brings people together. After all, this is Pre-Alpha, I expect to find oddities like this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Well this might come off weird since it isn’t directly related to a playing experience in-game but rather due to a name of encounters. Recently playing we did a word jumble and the Gadai Bandits just made us laugh for hours! But not because of something that happend or they did. If you break it down into 2 words Ga &amp; Dai and think about Kilsin and that awesome Australian accent it actually sounds like Good (Ga) Day (Dai) and all we did for the rest of the session was constantly say Ga`Dai Mate. It just proves that the little things relating to Pantheon can create memorable moments.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I have posted detailed feedback on the majority of my testing sessions. There has been a healthy mix of constructive criticism, dissenting opinion, and well deserved praise. My favorite moment was seeing a reaction from Convo toward some of my feedback. Team VR is the real deal and it's a privilege to see all of the thought, care, and consideration that goes into their work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">PA1, Session 2. Session 1 was just filled with wondrous awe. "Look at that!" “Look at this!" "I'm killing a spider. A Rat! Woohoo! Go Go Go!" Session 2 I found myself in a group with 4 complete strangers. Killing skeletons at the Thronefast ruins. Just chit chattin amongst ourselves and learning our character abilities. One of us was out looking for more skeletons to kill when one spawned right in front of us. Instantly, 4 of us spammed group chat with "POP!" I can't say the last time I was in a group in an MMO when everyone was keyed in on what was going on around them. And I can't say the last time anyone felt the need to say "pop" in a group. What an awesome feeling that was! 5 complete strangers. Having shared experiences from long in the past. Being brought forth into a new world. Bring that feeling back Pantheon!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">3. How are you finding the community?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I think the Pantheon community in general is the best that I have ever been a part of. I have shared meaningful dialogue with hundreds of members and the shared passion and interest for this project is nothing short of magic. The PA community in particular, though, has been outstanding. We're all very fortunate to have such dedicated people investing their time and energy into all things Pantheon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The community has been great! Helpful. Informative. Constructive. We're all out to help the developers build the best game they can. We've all bought into the vision. That's why we're here. Keep true to that vision! There are some very passionate people in this community. If they perceive significant straying from that vision, there will be some serious pushback.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Every community has its good people and its bad people. Overall, I feel like the Pantheon community all wants the same thing in their own way. A great bunch of people I have enjoyed getting to know both while testing and on the forums.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The testing community has been fantastic. There will always be a few annoying people in any crowd. But, overall, I finally get to meet and play with all the people I have been chatting with on the forums.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The community is, simply put, AWESOME. the willingness to help each other and be supportive to one another is outstanding couldn't wish for a better community than the one we have right now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The community has been great! It’s what you would expect from this kind of game. You have all kinds of different personalities. There is always some hilarious banter going on in out of character chat. People have been really friendly and helpful to each other. There are a lot of people eager to find groups, socialize and make new friends. I’m excited to see such a healthy community so early in the game’s development.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The community uniqueness and passion is undeniable. With passion comes the excitement and desire to share ideas, which can sometimes lead into some negative human behavior. I have rarely witnessed that within this community. I have seen a lot of respect in letting others voice their opinions and share their ideas which have lead into discussions that stretch and path those in all directions and levels.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">4. What's your favorite zone?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">As it stands right now, I have not spent much time in Faerthale, the little bit I have spent there peaked my interest. However at this point I would have to say that Avendyr's Pass is currently my favorite zone. The team has done some amazing work with the way the zone looks, the layout, the feels, everything! Walking through the hills and the forest not knowing what is out there ready to eat you for an afternoon snack makes you really pay attention. I also like the fact that it is not a single level range zone, there are things for multiple level ranges, such as bandits near the Thronefast zone and then the higher level Orcs in the icy mountains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Halnir Cave. I'm a dungeon guy. This is the only dungeon available so far. So Halnir's it is. I would love to see a few more branches in the zone. Some pockets off to the side and out of the way. Overall cool ambiance. And good level range for a starter dungeon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Hmm. This is tricky, but at this time from what i have seen and been privileged to explore it has to be Avendyr's Pass. I love how that zone is broken down into multiple biomes...and then there was snow. The dense forest make it absolutely beautiful. This is one zone i cannot wait to see in the dark and with weather. I really get the sense of a pass and just feel lost to the wild at times. The level of detail already this early on. Everything feels natural. A forest is a forest even the buildings and paths feel right. You can tell a lot of time and thought has gone into the development of the game. Lots of passion to be seen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Definitely Black Rose Keep. The building and design is fantastic. The population makes it feel like a real fort. Plenty of corners for mobs to hide behind. As a tank, pulling has to be done thoughtful there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Halnir Cave. While the zone does feel a big congested at times, I know there are plans to expand it to some degree in the future. It's on the back-burner for now while the team continues to work on other areas of King's Reach in an effort to prepare for Alpha testing. That said, this zone is definitely my favorite chunk of content that is currently available in game. It's a lot of the little details that really add up and make this zone special, for me. NPC placement, diversity, pathing, itemization, bosses, door locking mechanisms, darkness, danger, and the sense of adventure and exploration that are byproducts of those things. There is still plenty of room for improvement but the extra attention to detail that has gone into HC really sets the bar for me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I think that would have to be Avendyr’s Pass. The view at certain vantage points are absolutely stunning. The zone is huge, with many varied areas that can accommodate a large amount of players and level ranges. There are a lot of surprises too! I would encourage all players current and future to spend time exploring this area in its entirety.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I’m a sucker for Halnir Cave. Something about those little spit-fire spiders and working to get past them makes me feel so accomplished!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">5. While in early development there are always bound to be some silly bugs. What is the silliest bug you've seen?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">So this is fairly easy to answer, it’s the water bug. So basically at this time there is a water animation bug when a character swims in the water their legs stay in a vertical position while their upper body takes a horizontal approach and this carries on when exiting the water for a brief moment. It's a delightful silly bug.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">In some cases when players die, their death animation and sound loop in rapid succession. It’s quite comical, but what’s even funnier is when my group mates mimic the sound in our voice chat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">During one session, my group and I were in Halnir Cave and had been working on Ashbarran for quite some time. One of my group members had to go afk and he went to a spot that had no mobs and was assumed safe. Out of nowhere, a ghost mob spawned across the room, moved to him, killed him and chained back to its place. It didn’t aggro any other group member nearby. Being the ever-noble Cleric, I rezzed him and his character immediately popped back up. And, then the mob did the exact same thing. This cycle of amusement lasted for at least 10 minutes, and the entire group was literally rolling on the floor laughing until our group member returned. As soon as he moved a bit, the mob did not aggro him anymore. Our group member did end up forgiving me in the end!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The best bug I have seen is two summons pets cause AE damage to each other. Then they aggroed each other and fought to the death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">There have been quite a few goofy bugs but there is one particular session in PA3 that really stands out. The paladin in my group figured out a way to pull any mob in the same zone from unlimited range, and with no line of sight requirement. So … he decided to hang out on top of a mountain to get a really good view of the surrounding area. Our group spread out and we utilized the /assist function for some really crazy pulls. Social aggro was triggering all over the place and before we knew it, we had what appeared to be the largest train … ever. If that wasn't crazy enough, our paladin also found out a way to become permanently invulnerable. I watched what appeared to be hundreds of mobs beating on him to no avail while armies of reinforcements could be seen running toward the same fate, from all directions, and from miles away. There were so many mobs that some appeared to be flying while others were half-buried inside the mountain, on all sides. At one point it looked like we had an "Abomination" type mob in front of us ... you know, a 5 headed orc with 13 arms, 9 legs, tails, tusks protruding from horrible places ... the whole nine yards. I'm actually quite shocked that we didn't crash the zone while doing this. Our paladin must have felt like a demi-god that session.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">While out exploring Avendyrs Pass, I found myself swimming in the river/stream. There were several waterfalls on the way down into the valley. I'd swim over these and splash down below. But on one waterfall, I didn't fall. I just kept on swimming out into the open air. I was basically flying. I had access to the entire zone from a nice safe distance. After exploring the entire zone from a birds eye view, I decided to see what would happen when I engaged a bandit. It did not go well. Even though I was way above him and out of reach, once I attacked him, he turned and swung (from 40 ft below) and hit me. Knocking my flight off and dropping me to the ground where he thoroughly pummeled me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Hah! The best thing I have seen so far is Aradune running around Throneast in his red underwear wielding two flaming swords. If I am not mistaken, I believe this is due to the fact that the Human models were being worked on and the gear did had not been fitted to the new model yet.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">6. Do you have any advice for other testers?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Have fun with it! Don’t get bogged down in the details and worry too much about where the game is at. Report issues and give feedback on the game’s fundamentals and overall feel, rather than balance or tuning. Things are changing and getting better all the time, and will continue to do so as testing moves forward. Trust the process.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Patience. It’s a rough ride, but worth it. Instead of yelling about issues on the forums, replicate them, report them, and move on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">My best advice would be to have fun, but always remember you are here as a tester and not for early access. That being said, if you happen to find a bug don't stop there, attempt to reproduce the bug because if you can reproduce it the developers will be able to as well. Also keep in mind while reporting it provide as much step-by-step detail as you can to reproduce the issue as this can significantly reduce the time spent by the developers in trying to reproduce the issue found and make the more efficient in the long run.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I would encourage all testers to provide feedback if/when possible. Anything class focused is particularly helpful right now, especially if you post it in the corresponding class threads created by Joppa. (Thank you for starting those threads by the way!) I would also suggest that people take a little extra time to read up on the feedback that has been shared by other testers. I have been keeping tabs on all of the class specific threads and most of the general feedback in an effort to absorb as much information as possible. It's been really helpful for me as it allows me to better prepare for each session and be as productive with my time as possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Have fun. And definitely check out Faethale even in its early state some sights to be seen. All I can say is those bears man! When i first saw them i was like WTH and for a brief moment panicked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">My advice is to just relax. Have fun. Just be in the moment and enjoy it! The time goes so incredibly fast. It’s good to have goals and want to level and all that, but if you don’t take time to explore and appreciate all the hard work and the little details that the Devs have created, then you are missing out on some incredibly amazing things!

Don't expect the world. Don't expect a completed game. Don't expect a working game. Don't get frustrated because you can't log in successfully. Seek advice and remain calm. The devs and community have been very forthcoming with advice on how to resolve any problems. Just be respectful and have patience.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">7. What's the one thing you'd like people who are not in PA to know about Pantheon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Darran L.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I can't really explain it in words to those who have not experienced it. There is often doubt, or concern that the developers are not producing or that they are having major issues and will be unable to finish the game. But from the inside looking out, I can tell you first hand that between each of the Pre-Alpha sessions there have been leaps and bounds of progress made towards the end goal. Yes the game is still way early in development, but the progress being made is unreal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Steven R.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The future looks bright my friends. The improvements are noticeable from session to session. And the devs passion for this world is on display every time they open it up for us to participate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Pauline M.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I'd like people to know that the game is developing with each minute. What you see at one moment or on one stream and/or video may change to the next. Every time I get to log into a session, the improvements are extraordinary! I have no hesitation in saying that this game will be the MMO that everyone is currently dreaming about. Don’t rush the process and let the team build it right. It will be worth the wait.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Nick W.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The foundation for a fantastic game is here. It’s the game that many of us have been waiting on for many, many years. It’s very fun and can be a game to call home for a long time to come. I urge the community to have patience with the team, and keep supporting Pantheon. The wait will be worth it!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jason F.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">That the game is moving along well and that those testing are making sure Pantheon will be all it can be and more with the development team behind it. Even in such an early state its been a pretty solid ride. How ever long it takes this game is going to Rock! But if could reveal one thing to those not in PA Brad is creating a world here. I swear the grass grows when the servers are down PA 2 - PA 3 i kid you not the grass grew it took the gardner a day or so to trim it down! It felt though as if it did even if i am imagining things that's how immersive the game feels. But in all seriousness the Perception system is going to be pretty friggin awesome.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Jonathan J.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Although the game is far from done, its developing a fantastic feel. The devs are clearly listening to input.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;"><strong>Tommy G.</strong></span> <span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">The Vision, and more importantly, The Grand Vision, are alive and well. While VR is definitely focused on core gameplay elements right now, I think it's incredibly important that everybody knows that Brad McQuaid is more involved now than ever. VR is a small team and many of them wear multiple hats. Just know that they are listening, watching, reading, discussing, sharing, observing, learning, applying, and growing. 2018 has been a great year for Pantheon but 2019 is going to be the best yet. Continue to be engaged, promote the game, and help Pantheon push the genre forward. Onward and upward</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">1) What is your main character's in-game name and how did you come up with it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Janus. There's no interesting backstory to the name other than that I like the concept of the Roman God who bears that name and it was the name of a character from one of my favorite RPGs as a kid called Chrono Trigger. I had another name I did use for the last 20 years in previous games but Janus will suffice from here on out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">2) What interests you the most about Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">That question brings us to the concept of an MMORPG, a genre of game I've enjoyed since Meridian 59. Since around 2006 and on, however, I've felt that MMORPGs have increasingly lost what made them an RPG to begin with. Between action-based combat elements, simplified abilities and loadouts, redundant and quick dungeon crawls within a linear fashion and a community where few ever talk to each other, MMORPGs of late have become in my opinion generic MMOs. Pantheon to me is a return to methodical role based combat; challenging content of such that there's risk at every step. Because of that risk you'll want a group to tackle it effectively and when you do the feeling of accomplishment is that much more meaningful. On top of that the class design and group dynamics along with the return of the 'Quaternity' helped pique my interest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">3) What will your main race and class be and why?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I'll definitely play an Enchanter but it's the race I'm having trouble with. With illusions, I could have answered the 'race' question jokingly with, "All of them". I did, however, play a single Enchanter for 95% of my time in EverQuest from 1999-2006. The class design just fit my playstyle and the sheer range of abilities and tools at your disposal made for a class that I never grew tired of. While I did play a Dark Elf in EverQuest and in Vanguard if I had to guess in Pantheon it would probably be a selection of either a Human, Elf or Dark Myr. Although lately I've been intrigued in building my character around the Magic the Gathering character Jace Beleren so it may end up being Human in the end.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"></p>

<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">4) What is your favorite system, mechanic or feature so far in Pantheon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">I'm an engineer so I'd have to say it's the return of a lot of the solid mechanics from classic MMORPGs that interest me the most. Although not new, the idea of attribute modifiers or coefficients tacked on to abilities within a combat system like Pantheon should be incredibly fun. The only aspect I was worried about with a return of the classic MMORPG was how caster classes would be able to differentiate in focus and performance. This is one area I've taken particular interest in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">5) If you could enter the game and visit anywhere in Terminus for 1 hour, where would you go and why?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">Amberfaet. When I first saw the zone, in my head it felt like a combination of Velkator's Labyrinth and Permafrost, two zones from the game EverQuest. You have Velketor's Labyrinth where players careen the ice shelves at increasingly deadly heights and then you have Permafrost where you're moving into the greater expanse of the zone and eventually to the ice dragon, Lady Vox. Amberfaet however, looks to be unbelievably more vast and worrisome for any potential adventurer. I'd be lying if I said the other reason I selected Amberfaet wasn't because of curiosity of what lies beyond the door past the frigid walkway. Of course, that brings us to why I chose Permafrost as the second analogy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">6) Finally, if you had to choose between any Pantheon city to live in in real life which one would you choose and why?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:start;"><span style="color: rgb(255,255,255);font-size: 18px;font-family: Arial;">It'd be a tie between the Gnomish city of Skyhold and the Elvish city of Faerthale. On one hand, I like good architecture which would have me lean towards Elves. On the other hand, Gnomes looks like they're made out of candy and I have a sweet tooth. Before people become upset I'm not a Gnome so technically it's not cannibalism.</span>&nbsp;</p>
